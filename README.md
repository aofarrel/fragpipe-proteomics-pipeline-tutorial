# FragPipe Proteomics Pipeline Tutorial
____  

Goal: Use FragPipe Proteomics Pipeline to analyze the proteome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma samples.  
  
Steps:
1.  Run FragPipe Convert-Identify-PeptideProphet on 2 plexes
2.  Run FragPipe ProteinProphet on all 23 plex workspaces  in 1 task
3.  Run FragPipe Filter-Quant-Report on 2 plex workspaces  
4.  Run FragPipe TMT-Integrator and QC on all 23 PSM files  
5.  Use RStudio to interactively QC the outputs of TMT-Integrator and cluster (?)
